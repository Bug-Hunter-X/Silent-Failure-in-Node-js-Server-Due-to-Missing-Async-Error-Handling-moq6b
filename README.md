# Silent Failure in Node.js Server Due to Missing Async Error Handling

This repository demonstrates a common error in Node.js applications where asynchronous operations within HTTP request handlers lack proper error handling.  This can lead to silent failures, making debugging difficult.

The `bug.js` file contains the problematic code. The `bugSolution.js` file provides a corrected version with robust error handling.

## Problem

The server uses `doAsyncOperation` to simulate an asynchronous task that might fail. If the operation fails, the error is logged to the console, but the client receives no indication of failure.  In a production environment, this missing error handling can lead to unexpected behavior and make identifying the root cause challenging.

## Solution

The corrected code in `bugSolution.js` explicitly handles errors within the response callback.  If `doAsyncOperation` fails, the server responds with an appropriate error status code and message, providing clear feedback to the client.  This ensures better error handling and makes the application more robust and maintainable.
